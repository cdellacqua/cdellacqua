I'm a freelance cross-platform developer 🖥️ 💻 📱 🌐

#### 🚧 What I develop

I write Web and cross-platform/hybrid applications for Android, iOS and Desktop platforms.

I also develop libraries and UI toolkits that enable faster development cycles and boost productivity, especially when working in a team.

#### 🛠️ My tools - programming languages

TypeScript is the programming language I use the most. More and more often, I work on projects involving Rust, which range from Backend services to embedded applications.
During my career, I've also worked on some projects using C++, C#, PHP, Java and Kotlin.

#### 🌴 Hobbies

I develop and maintain some open-source projects 🌐, and I love electronics 📻, 3D printing 🖨️ and the Maker world in general 🏗️. I also love automation, especially when it combines electronics, mechanics and information technology.
