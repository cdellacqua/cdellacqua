I'm a freelance cross platform developer 🖥️ 💻 📱 🌐

#### 🚧 What I develop

I mainly develop Web applications (React, Svelte, SolidJS), as well as Android, iOS and Desktop apps using cross platform (React Native) or hybrid (Ionic, Capacitor, Electron, Tauri) frameworks.

In addition to applications, I often write libraries and UI toolkits that enable faster development cycles and boost team productivity.

#### 🛠️ My tools - programming languages

TypeScript is the programming language I use on a daily basis to build Frontends and Backends. I've recently started learning Rust 👨🏻‍💻, and I'm already a big fan!
During my career, I've also had the opportunity to work on small projects coding with C++, C# and PHP.

#### 🌴 Hobbies

I develop and maintain some open source projects 🌐 and I love electronics 📻, 3D printing 🖨️ and the Maker world in general 🏗️. I also love automation, especially when it involves electronics, mechanics and information technology.
